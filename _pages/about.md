Hi,my name is Haoyuan Liang (Chinese: 梁浩源).I am a third-year Master's student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Sun Yat-sen University.  
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation,Shanghai University. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Juepeng Zheng](https://hail-alloy-af4.notion.site/Juepeng-Zheng-d3b70a4b409145139c91e55813cc80fa) at the [Intelligent Geospatial Computing and Sensing (IGCS) Lab](https://rssysu.github.io/).  



## 📖 Research
My research interests are broad, spanning several areas in artificial intelligence and large Language model training.  
In particular, I focus on the following topics:
- **⭐ Federated Learning**— including domain generalization, and personalized aggregation strategies.  
- **Multimodal Representation Learning** — exploring cross-modal alignment and knowledge fusion between vision, language, and audio modalities.  
- **Large Language Model Fine-Tuning** — with an emphasis on parameter-efficient adaptation and optimization of foundation models.  
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architectures** — investigating modular routing, expert specialization, and distributed training efficiency.  
- **Foundation Models for Remote Sensing** — building large-scale geospatial pretraining frameworks for earth observation and environmental applications.

## ❤️ Hobby

Outside of research, I’m also a **fitness enthusiast** 🏋️‍♂️ and **basketball lover** 🏀.  
Feel free to reach out if you’d like to **work out together** or **play a game** — I’m always up for some healthy competition and training! 💪  

💬 In addition, I serve as an **emotional consultant**, and I’m always open to sharing insights or offering advice if you ever need to talk about relationships or personal growth. ❤️

📩 <span style="color:blue">
If you have an exciting idea or would like to collaborate on my research topics, feel free to reach out via 
[email](mailto:lianghy68@mail2.sysu.edu.cn) or [WeChat](../images/wechat.png) — I’m always open to discussion and new collaborations.  
And beyond research, if you’d like to **chat about fitness or basketball**, or even **share and talk about life and relationships**, you’re more than welcome to connect with me! 🌟️
